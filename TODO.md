# Things TO DO.

A list of the things I have to do in the different main containers and application as a whole.

## APP

- [ ] Making the routing to be full width and height.
- [ ] Make it a little bit mobile friendly.
- [ ] App is now responsive.
- [ ] Change the overall palette of colors.
- [x] Install Lodash to increase efficiency.
- [x] Document at least a function.
- [ ] Document at least 50%.
- [ ] Document EVERYTHING.
- [ ] TEST ANYTHING.
- [ ] Test practically everything.

## Bio

- [ ] Generate structure for showing the data.
- [ ] Fix the html/css of the side menu.
- [ ] Add transitions to the component.

## Projects

- [ ] Organize projects by [language? what they do?].
- [ ] Add transitions to the component.

## Nature

## Challenges

- [x] Create the structure for the controllers of the sketches.

## Hub

To remember: every container should be in charge of their own menu.
