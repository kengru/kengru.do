- After I have some posts, I should email nowx3.com for this blog to be integrated into their page :).
- ~~Write a /uses page.~~
- ~~Create a PR to add `/uses` to uses.tech~~
- ~~Order posts on the main page by published date.~~
- ~~Make this work on Desktop.~~
- Create a rss feed for this blog.
- ~~Add description into the meta tag of posts.~~
- Fix favicon.
- Maybe add post images as a meta tag and on the properties of a md file.
- Implement a search functionality.
- Add some more meta tags for discoverability on the hobbie projects.
