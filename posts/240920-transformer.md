Including in this page, I normally have some need of image
manipulation, either turning images to webp, compressing
down images or rezising them.

I was using [cloud convert](https://cloudconvert.com/) and
it was nice for the most part but after converting about
8 images it asked me to pay. So I did what any respectable
programmer would do in my case, I created my own solution
for this issue.

Its called Transformer and it's online. Processed files stay
active for about 5 minutes then they are deleted so I don't
need to worry about other people using it.

This is my second attempt at doing this, but this time I like
it a lot more.

Thank you!
