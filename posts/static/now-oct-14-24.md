This is a page that contains the things I'm doing or working at the moment, I will update this regularly.

Last update: October 14, 2024

### Personal

- Expecting a child for January 2025, pretty excited about it and I'm constantly reading to feel a bit more secure going into it.
- Bought a [bunch](/bought-books-1) of books and I'm planning on reading and review them as I go.
- I retook creating generative art and started with [something](/milo-1). I would love to print out the results and give some of them to my family.
- Taking writing seriously.
- Buying a motorcycle?

### Projects

- I'll be working on some hobbie projects under the [Odin](https://github.com/odin-software) umbrella, working on re-making a tool for file conversion.

### Work

- I'm working at [X-Team](https://x-team.com/) as a full-stack engineer.
- Taking work as a software consultant, mostly web development.
