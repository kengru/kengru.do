A clever and entertaining book that may go over your head if you do not give it a chance.

It starts very confusing and keeps getting more confusing until you reach the middle of the book when suddenly old stories
being told start making sense of the world.

I was very entertained reading it and the concept of an antimeme was novel to me.

I give it a 3/5, I liked it but I would not read it a second time.
