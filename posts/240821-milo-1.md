A month ago I drew this on one of my notebooks:

![Milo Doodle](/static/images/milo-1/milo_doodle.webp "Milo Doodle")

It was an idea to create a shaded rectangle inside another
shaded rectangle but with the lines rotated 90 degrees. I played
with the idea on [p5.js](https://p5js.org) for a while and ended up
with these:

![Milo Rectangle 1](/static/images/milo-1/milo_rect1.webp "Milo Rectangle 1")

![Milo Rectangle 2](/static/images/milo-1/milo_rect2.webp "Milo Rectangle 2")

And while the results were looking great, I couldn't stop wondering what
this would look like if instead of shaded rectangles I used shaded circles
instead. I did some experiments with shading the circles with lines but
it did not feel like lines and circles were a great match.

After a conversation with a friend, I started trying to shade the circles
not with lines but with curves. This gave way to what I would say is the
finished product, circles shaded with curves. The curves are a copy
of the same circle but with the center of the curves moved off the middle
of the screen. It may sound complicated to comprehend but it's a basic
idea that was just hard to code. This is another doodle trying to explain
the concept:

The result was better than I expected and it helped me to make it very
configurable with parameters so that I can get all of these kinds of
variations:

![Milo Circle 4](/static/images/milo-1/milo_circle_4.webp "Milo Circle 4")

In the last one, I added some lines in the middle to see how it would look
like, I also animated some with rotations and you can see it in this [gif](https://x.com/kxngru/status/1821554636324499578).
I will be making some prints of the ones I liked the most.
This was a fun experiment and I hope you enjoyed reading the process.

Thank you!
