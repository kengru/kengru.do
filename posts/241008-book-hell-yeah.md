"What would you do then, if you didn’t need the money and didn’t need the attention?"

That's a strong start.

This book is a collection of essays written in [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs)'s blog,
curated around the theme of how to know what is worth doing.

One morning, I sat down to start reading this book and found that phrase in the first essay.
I immediately put the book down and started trying to answer that question as honestly as
I could. This led be to grab my thinking notebook, where I began adding and removing
bullet points of actions I've wanted to take for the past four years and hadn't started yet.

I spent about 20 minutes trying to select one thing. Eventually, I decided that reading
a bit more might be the best approach to start answering the question.

As I countinued reading, I found that the answer became clearer. With each essay it
felt like I was peeling back a layer of fog surrounding what's truly important to me.
I think, if I didn’t need money or attention, I would play video games and share that
experience with my family. I often avoid playing because it doesn’t bring me money,
but it’s something I care about and love doing. Being involved in the video game
industry would be nice too, but I know that making video games as a job would probably
make me hate it.

These were my favorite essays:

- [If you’re not feeling “hell yeah!” then say no](https://sive.rs/hyn)
- [Disconnect](https://sive.rs/dc)
- [232 sand dollars](https://sive.rs/232)
- [How to do what you love and make good money](https://sive.rs/balance)
- [You don’t need confidence, just contribution.](https://sive.rs/contrib)
- [Parenting : Who is it really for?](https://sive.rs/pa)
- [Goals shape the present, not the future.](https://sive.rs/goals) (resonates a lot with me)

This is a great book, full of good advices, food for though, and carefully curated insigths.
I think there is at least one essay that would reasonate with any kind of person.
I would recomend this book to anyone.
