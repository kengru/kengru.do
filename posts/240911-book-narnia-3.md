![The Horse and His Boy](/static/images/books/narnia-3.webp "The Horse and His Boy")

This is my favorite book of the series so far, it's full
of cool mini-plots, crazy adventure and Christian symbolism.

The protagonists are trapped in Calormen, a country depicted
as a middle eastern desert with Sultans and Camels. They are
desperate to leave into a foreign, almost legendary, land
called Narnia, where there are springs, trees and even talking
beasts. In this tale, Narnia represents hope, a place worth
having an adventure through an unforgiving land.

By this point, there is no further evidence needed to understand
that Aslan is a representation of God. The heroes are attacked
and also saved by a Lion in more than one occasion and it's clear
at the end that whatever happens that lead you to where you
belong its God's will. God will chase you out of the places
you are not supposed to be. God will take care of you when
you feel lonely. God will push you to your limits so that you
can conquer your fears and achieve what you must.

This story happens between the first 2 movies and feels like
it's setting up for something bigger in the future.

The boy is a good and humble character and the horse is very
funny.
