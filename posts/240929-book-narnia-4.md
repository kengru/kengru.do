![Prince Caspian](/static/images/books/narnia-4.webp "Prince Caspian")

This book tells a great story of an oppressed group of Narnians
and their quite preparations to return to their former glory.

I liked how they built up the character of Prince Caspian from
a heir of the usurper's throne to a man worth following.

This story brings back the children from the second book, as
they are once again taken out of their world to play a mayor role
into restoring the kingdom of Narnia. However, this time they are not
presented as saviors but as facilitators of the story. They come
to help the Narnians save themselves.

There is a strange part where the boys address a dwarf by
a somewhat of derrogatory name and they continue to do so even
after the dwarf ask them not to. I guess it's a thing of the times
(though he did tried to belittle them a bit).

The end of the book is very exciting, with Peter (the oldest boy)
having a one-on-one match with the leader of the Telmarines.
This leads to Caspian becoming the new High King of Narnia,
and the kids returning to their homes. Aslan tells the oldest
children that they will not return to Narnia because they are
too old. I guess that is C.S. Lewis's way of saying that fantasy
and adventure was for the realm of the children, which makes
sense.

Another great book.
