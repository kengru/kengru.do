![Prince Caspian](/static/images/books/narnia-4.webp "Prince Caspian")

This book tells a great story of an oppressed group of Narnians
and their silent preparations to return to former glory.

I liked how they builded up the character of Prince Caspian from
a heir of the usurpers throne to a man worth following.

This story brings back the children from the second book as
they are taken out of their world once again to play a mayor role
into restoring the kingdom of Narnia, but this time they are not
presented as saviors but as facilitators to the story. They came
to help Narnians save themselves.

There is a strange part where the boys address a dwarf by
some kind of derrogatory name and they continue to do so even
after the dwarf ask them not to. Guess its a thing of the times
(he did tried to belittle them a bit though).

The end of the book is very cool, with Peter (the oldest boy)
having a one on one match with the leader of the Telmarines.
This results in Caspian becoming the new high king of Narnia
and the kids returning to their homes. Aslan tells the oldests
children that they will not return to Narnia because they are
too old, I guess that is C.S. Lewis way of saying that fantasy
and adventure was for the realm of the children, which makes
sense.

Another great book.
