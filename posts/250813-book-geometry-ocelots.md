What a book!

I've followed [exurb1a](https://www.youtube.com/@Exurb1a) for a long while, he is a Youtuber and author of science fiction and
philosophy books and videos. I decided last year to buy some of his books as part of my [book buying last year](https://kengru.do/bought-books-1)
and I don't regret it at all.

This book is a masterpiece on science fiction and love. It takes on religion, science, politics, philosophy, family and man itself.

I now have a favorite moment of 2025 where I was reading a love letter from a mother to her son while listening to [127 North by Caspian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EzKkFCimRk&pp=ygUJMTI3IG5vcnRo).
It brought tears to my eyes and reminded me again why music is so powerful and how parenthood is something so important to me. I
wish some day I could write something so beautiful.

It has a great final chapter and a conclusion that I think couldn't be better.

I'll give it a 5/5, I would read it again and it's now on my newly created list of: "Books I'll give my daughter to read... eventually."
