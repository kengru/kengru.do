First of all, I **loved** this book.

Alison challenges the popular idea of **parenting** by presenting
a different way of taking care of children. The modern model
of **parenting** is to try and mold your child into what we
believe could be a functionally productive adult in our
society. This, to Alison (and to me), is just how a carpenter
works, their piece is treated with the utmost detail
so that the result will look as it is pictured in their head.

I think the gardener's way of looking at your child that the
book presents sounds both more demanding and rewarding. To
care for a child has a new meaning for me, the job of a
caretaker is never to create a type of adult but to provide
an environment where adaptability reigns. We **cannot** predict
the future. The children born today will have their own
set of difficulties and opportunities, if we choose to
rigidly dictate the path they will take, we are leaving
them with no room for the unknowns and no one but ourselves
to blame.

I'm sure I will be coming back to this book in the near
future.
