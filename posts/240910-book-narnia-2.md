A lot of people know this story because of the movie adaptation.
It's a very mysterious story from the beginning and it's intended
to be that way, it's the official start of the Narnia universe,
C. S. Lewis had thought of making a book about a Lion and created
a masterpiece.

But coming from reading The Magician's Nephew some of the mystery
dissipated by knowing how everything began and where it was that
the heroes stumbled upon entering the wardrobe. I even know who
the lion and the witch are!

This does not stop the story from being great. There are a good
number of examples of good behaviors and bad ones. For example,
if you have someone you love and they come to you yelling that
they were in a forest and met a faun and it was winter, and it
all happened while they were hiding in the wardrobe of the house,
you should probably start worrying about their mental health
but not before you wholeheartedly try to understand and believe
that at the least, they did experience this.

Also, don't listen to a witch who gives delicious candy in
a forest.

A group of brothers and sisters save the day by being brave and
righteous, I'm feeling a little bit of a theme in these books.
By a little bit I mean these are all Christian books and I love them.

The last thing I'll mention is how short the last battle is in
the book as opposed to the movie. The Chronicles of Narnia is
a story about the good triumphing above the bad, but most of all,
a story about adventure.
