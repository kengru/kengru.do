In this episode of hobbie projects, a rss feeder that works great and is cheap to mantain for me.

### What is Nyusu?

It's a rss feed reader made with Go and SQLite that can be selfhosted locally or easily deployed anywhere that can serve a simple server. It's a way to keep track of the latests posts from your favorite blogs or podcasts.

### Why is Nyusu?

When I'm outside of my house I do not carry with me any social media app
or any way to mindlessly entertain myself (which I'm glad of that)
but there are some times where there is not much to do, for example when
waiting in a doctor's office. For those times I usually carry a book
but it can be inconvenient, that is why I wanted something productive to
do in my phone, and what better way for me than to read and learn on the
go.

Reading articles has always been something I love to do, to glimpse into a person's point of view and expertise is something wonderful.
