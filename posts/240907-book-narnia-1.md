![The Magician's Nephew](/static/images/books/narnia-1.webp "The Magician's Nephew")

The Magician's Nephew tells the story of the creation
of Narnia, but more importanly, a story about a boy,
a girl, and a cabby.

Here are some thoughts on this book:

### The Boy & The Girl

Braveness and curiosity are key for any story about
adventure. Digory and Polly have no lack of these, which
is why a figure like Aslan, which I presume is God in
this story, recognizes them as worthy witnesses of the
creation of the world. They are examples of how a
child should go around their life: With confidence and
wonder.

### The Cabby

The cab driver is shown as a man who grew up in the country
side of London. He is calm, kind and strong. In the book
these traits lead him to become the first King of Narnia.
This is ironic since in the "real world" he is a poor
cab driver and the wonderful characteristics he possess
are undervalued by everyone.

### Review

What I liked the most out of this book is the depiction
of a childhood that I experienced in some ways.
Having less distractions leads to more adventures.

The Chronicles of Narnia were not written in **chronological**
order (by chronological I mean from the point of view of
Narnians). I am, however, reading these books in **chronological order**
going from the creation of Narnia to "The last battle".
